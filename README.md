**How to install**


1) You'll need Python for this. If you don't have it, install it from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3137/ (latest install as of 27/09/2025)
2) Once that's installed, run this command in command prompt: pip install pygame pyinstaller
3) Wait for that to finish, then unzip this file to a chosen place. Remember this.
4) Double click the exe file and it'll show up!
**
If for any reason you want to change the number its maxed too (base is 100000) do the following:**

1) Open the python file included with notepad or (preferably) Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code
2) Change this (line 31) number = random.randint(1, 100000) to random.randint(1, your_number_here)
3) Save the file again (ctrl+s)
4) Run pyinstaller --onefile random_number_1.0.py in command prompt IN THE DIRECTORY THAT YOU'VE INSTALLED THIS.
5) Wait for that to finish, then it'll update the app. Run it again and the chosen max will be set.

Security notes: **

1) If a SmartScreen for security shows up, ignore it. This code is super simple. 
2) I've made this for simplicity, not for money/data. I don't care about hacking you.

**Other notes:**

I don't want donations. This was a simple code made an amateur coder. 
If something goes wrong, please let me know at harryslaptopfromasus@outlook.com. I cant guarantee I'll look at it, but I probably will.
